I am excitedly going to start Career Foundry's Front End Developer Bootcamp On September 9, 2019. I began learning how to code a while ago and am eager to return to being immersed in the world of learning JavaScript again! 

Upon completing the bootcamp I am looking forward to working at a great tech company here in Austin!
